The initial pass at the gogopher lib is complete!  The libary is capable of
reading local directories and translating them into gopher protocol, parsing
gopher map files, and communicating with remote gopher servers and handling
their responses.

The parser is pretty brute force - just reads into a large buffer and carves it
up.  The next step will be bringing the local directory and remote server 
routines into cohesion with each other, and then working on a streaming
protocol parser.

The external API shouldn't require more changes at this point.

I'm starting to put together in my head what's needed for the proper 
server - I want it to be solid and not just a quick hack.  Init
scripts, propery syslog monitoring, the works.  Should be fun.
