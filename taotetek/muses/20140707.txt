Had a dream last night - was in a crowd full of people at some sort
of space ship assembly plant.  Giant lumbering machines were carrying
pieces of a rocket out towards the launch platform.  They would perform
impossible manuevers, rolling and flipping like ballet dancers as 
they assembled the components of the ship.

People in the audience cheered and some visibly wept as they all shared
the culmination of some impossible project.
