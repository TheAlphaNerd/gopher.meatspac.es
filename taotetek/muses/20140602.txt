"There is a deeper magic. To name it is to destroy it, but to find it is to heal our selves. Our purpose is to find it, and when we find it, share it. I can't explain it any better than that, but as I write it, I feel it, and I know with absolute certainty that this is true."

I wrote those words years ago and I try my best to live them.

In a digital world full of parasitic systems of control designed to mine our interactions to generate wealth for others, my friend ednapiranha makes clearings to sit in and share magic.

Welcome.
